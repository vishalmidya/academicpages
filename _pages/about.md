<span style="text-align: justify"> 

I am an **assistant professor** of Environmental Health and Biostatistics in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Climate Science at **<span style = "color:blue">[Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/environmental-public-health)</span>**. Along with <span style = "color:blue">[Dr. Shoshannah Eggers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6JjgTmUAAAAJ)</span>, I serve as the co-director of the **[Microbial Exposomics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/microbial-exposomics/home)**. 

My overarching research interest lies in developing and applying interpretable machine learning models for environmental health research. My primary research focuses on (1) developing and applying models of temporal biodynamics of elemental signals that predict childhood or adolescent neurodevelopmental outcomes and (2) how the gut microbiome modifies these effects. 


Previously I did a Post Doctoral Fellowship with <span style ="color:blue">[Damaskini Valvi](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/valvi-damaskini)</span> at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, where I developed integrated statistical models to study how early life and life-course exposure to environmental chemicals impact cardio-metabolic health outcomes, with a particular focus on the mixture-effects and interactions of endocrine disrupting chemicals. I received PhD from _Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics_ at the <span style ="color:blue">[Pennsylvania State University](https://med.psu.edu/)</span> under <span style ="color:blue">[Jason Liao](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangangliao/)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Arthur Berg](http://www.personal.psu.edu/asb17/Homepage/Welcome.html)</span>. I wrote my thesis on <span style ="color:blue">[Frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing with a focus on meaningful effect sizes](https://www.proquest.com/pagepdf/2569643656?accountid=41157)</span> to enhance reproducibility in scientific studies. <span style="text-align: justify"> Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in _Statistics_ from <span style ="color:blue">[St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India](http://www.sxccal.edu/)</span> and _M.Stat (Masters of Statistics)_ from <span style ="color:blue">[Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/)</span>.</span> <span style="text-align: justify">I am a serious Matcha green tea aficionado. Outside of studies, I enjoy the outdoors, long-distance running, rowing, and volleyball.</span>

My current research can be broadly divided into three categories:

1. <span style="font-size: 20px">**_Machine-learning in environmental health_**

1. <span style="font-size: 20px">**_Exposomics, microbiome and human health_**

1. <span style="font-size: 20px">**_Environmental epidemiology_**
