<span style="text-align: justify"> 

I am an **assistant professor** at _Division of Biostatistics_ in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at <span style = "color:blue">[Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/environmental-public-health)</span>. My primary research focuses on how prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals and metals affects the childhood or adolescent gut microbiome, eventually leading to adverse health effects during the life course. I specialize in Biostatistical methods and incorporate tools from the machine learning literature. 

Previously I did a Post Doctoral Fellowship with <span style ="color:blue">[Damaskini Valvi](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/valvi-damaskini)</span> at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, where I developed integrated statistical models to study how early life and life-course exposure to environmental chemicals impact cardio-metabolic health outcomes, with a particular focus on the mixture-effects and interactions of endocrine disrupting chemicals. I received PhD from _Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics_ at the <span style ="color:blue">[Pennsylvania State University](https://med.psu.edu/)</span> under <span style ="color:blue">[Jason Liao](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangangliao/)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Arthur Berg](http://www.personal.psu.edu/asb17/Homepage/Welcome.html)</span>. I wrote my thesis on <span style ="color:blue">[Frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing with a focus on meaningful effect sizes](https://www.proquest.com/pagepdf/2569643656?accountid=41157)</span> to enhance reproducibility in scientific studies. <span style="text-align: justify"> Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in _Statistics_ from <span style ="color:blue">[St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India](http://www.sxccal.edu/)</span> and _M.Stat (Masters of Statistics)_ from <span style ="color:blue">[Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/)</span>.</span> <span style="text-align: justify">I am a serious Matcha green tea aficionado. Outside of studies, I enjoy the outdoors, long-distance running, rowing, and volleyball.</span>

My research can be broadly divided into three categories:

**Microbial Exposomics**
