I am an assistant professor  **Post Doctoral Fellow** at _Division of Biostatistics_ in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at <span style = "color:blue">[Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/environmental-public-health)</span>. My research focuses on how environmental chemicals affect the human gut microbiome, eventually leading to adverse health effects. He is specifically interested in understanding the altered group dynamics of microbes and their interactions with environmental chemicals. I specialize in exposure mixture statistical methods and incorporates tools from the machine learning literature. My current research focuses on deciphering how prenatal chemical interactions influence child gut health and respiratory outcomes.  

Previously I did a Post Doctoral Fellowship with <span style ="color:blue">[Damaskini Valvi](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/valvi-damaskini)</span> at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, where I developed integrated statistical models to study how early life and life-course exposure to environmental chemicals impact cardio-metabolic health outcomes, with a particular focus on the mixture-effects and interactions of endocrine disrupting chemicals. I received PhD from _Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics_ at the <span style ="color:blue">[Pennsylvania State University](https://med.psu.edu/)</span> under <span style ="color:blue">[Jason Liao](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangangliao/)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Arthur Berg](http://www.personal.psu.edu/asb17/Homepage/Welcome.html)</span>. I wrote my thesis on <span style ="color:blue">[Frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing with a focus on meaningful effect sizes](https://www.proquest.com/pagepdf/2569643656?accountid=41157)</span> to enhance reproducibility in scientific studies. <span style="text-align: justify"> Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in _Statistics_ from <span style ="color:blue">[St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India](http://www.sxccal.edu/)</span> and _M.Stat (Masters of Statistics)_ from <span style ="color:blue">[Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/)</span>.</span>

Codes for some of my papers and projects can be found in my <span style ="color:blue">[github profile](https://github.com/vishalmidya)</span>.

<span style="text-align: justify">I am a serious Matcha green tea aficionado. Outside studies, I enjoy long distance running, rowing, volleyball, cooking and <span style ="color:blue">[adda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adda_(South_Asian)</span>).</span>
